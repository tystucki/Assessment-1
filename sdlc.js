// Planning
// Analysis of Requirments
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration 
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirments = "This is the second step, in which developers will focus on the expectations of the product being built."
const design = "This is the third step, in which developers will strategically plan how the product will be built and run."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which developers will execute their design and buiild the product according to their plan."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fith step, in which developers will evaluate their code and fix any errors."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which developers change and update their code as needed, as well as fix any bugs or errors discovered in the code."
